A growtopia C++ internal cheat with enough features to avoid the need of purchasing one.
This internal has enough features, it is useless and completely visual to spend money for one.

- Sending packets, getting peer address etc.
- Doing any function calls
- SendPacketRaw and SendPacket
- Detouring any functions
- Receiving string and raw packets.
- Command line starts up after injection, but can easily be combined with ImGui and other stuff, it is freely editable and thats what makes this internal more powerful than any internal you would purchase.
